# Backend Fundamentals: 02

## 1. SQL vs NOSQL (When to Use What)

## What is SQL?

**SQL (Structured Query Language) databases** are relational databases that store data in structured tables (rows and columns) with predefined schemas.

### Examples

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Microsoft SQL Server

### Key Characteristics

- Structured schema (schema-on-write)
- Supports JOIN operations
- Strong ACID compliance
- Best for structured and relational data

## What is NoSQL?

**NoSQL databases** are non-relational databases designed for flexibility, scalability, and handling large volumes of distributed data.

### Types

- Document (e.g., MongoDB)
- Key-Value (e.g., Redis)
- Column-Family (e.g., Cassandra)
- Managed NoSQL (e.g., DynamoDB)

### Key Characteristics

- Flexible schema (schema-on-read)
- Horizontally scalable
- Optimized for large-scale distributed systems
- Often follow BASE consistency model

## Core Differences

```bash
| Feature        | SQL                        | NoSQL                           |
|----------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Data Model     | Tables (Relational)        | Document / Key-Value / Column   |
| Schema         | Fixed, predefined          | Dynamic, flexible               |
| Scaling        | Vertical (scale-up)        | Horizontal (scale-out)          |
| Transactions   | Strong ACID                | BASE / Eventual consistency     |
| Relationships  | Strong (JOIN support)      | Typically denormalized          |
```

## When to Use SQL

Use SQL when:

- You need complex queries and joins
- Strong data integrity is required
- The system is transactional
- Data structure is stable and well-defined

### Examples

- Banking systems
- ERP systems
- E-commerce order management

## When to Use NoSQL

Use NoSQL when:

- You need high scalability
- Data structure changes frequently
- Large volume of semi-structured/unstructured data
- Real-time or distributed systems

### Examples

- Social media feeds
- Logging systems
- IoT platforms
- Caching layers

<Note text="SQL databases are relational and schema-based, best suited for structured data and complex transactions requiring ACID compliance.

NoSQL databases are non-relational and schema-flexible, optimized for horizontal scalability and handling large volumes of semi-structured data.

I would choose SQL for transactional systems with strong consistency needs, and NoSQL for high-scale, distributed, or rapidly evolving applications."/>
